    "### Problem Description  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a kidney equation of $(x^2 + y^2)^2 = x^3 + y^3$ and digging a disc from the kidney with equation \n",
    "$(x-0.25)^2 + (y-0.25)^2 = 0.125$  \n",
    "Write a program to use the rectangle method to compute the area of the remaining kidney to 4 siginficant digits. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Description \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three rectangle methods that can be used, but the most accurate one is the midpoint method,   \n",
    "which is the one we will be using here! The midpoint method approximates the area underneath the curve      \n",
    "by having us evaluate the function value at the midpoint of every interval and take the sum.     \n",
    "The exact equation of the formula is as follows:    \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx \\approx \\Delta x[f(x_1) + f(x_2) + ..... + f(x_n)]$   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific case however, we have to do a bit more thinking. Considering a disk is being cut out of the kidney   \n",
    "and that the disk is in the equation form of a circle, we can easily compute it's area as a constant and subtract   \n",
    "from the approximation we get using the rectangle method on the kidney.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this method on the kidney, we need a clear way to calculate a y-value, in this case this will require us to   \n",
    "convert the equation into polar like so: \n",
    "\n",
    "$(x^2 + y^2)^2 = x^3 + y^3 \\rightarrow r^4 = r^3(sin^3\\theta + cos^3\\theta) \\rightarrow r = sin^3\\theta + cos^3\\theta$ \n",
    "\n",
    "With this we can actually perform the rectangle method as we can treat r as our y-value and the bounds for theta or what\n",
    "is essentially x in this case is from 0 to 2 $\\pi$. This has to be slightly adapted though as we are now in the polar plane, \n",
    "each \"rectangle\" instead of being f(x) * $\\Delta x$ it's now $1/2 * r^2 * \\Delta r$ as it's a circular cut. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is derived from the fact that a normal circle is $\\pi r^2$ which when only taking a fraction of the circle\n",
    "we get $(\\theta /(2 \\pi)) *(\\pi r^2)$  \n",
    "Thus simplifying to what we had stated prior! \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our formula, all that's left to decide is the number of intervals we want for our accuracy, in our case \n",
    "I believe 10,000 intervals will be enough to get me close to an approximation within 4 significant digits. \n",
