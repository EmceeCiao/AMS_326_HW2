    "### Problem Description  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a kidney equation of $(x^2 + y^2)^2 = x^3 + y^3$ and digging a disc from the kidney with equation \n",
    "$(x-0.25)^2 + (y-0.25)^2 = 0.125$  \n",
    "Write a program to use the rectangle method to compute the area of the remaining kidney to 4 siginficant digits. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Description \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three rectangle methods that can be used, but the most accurate one is the midpoint method, which is the one we will be using here! The midpoint method approximates the area underneath the curve by having us evaluate the function value at the midpoint of every interval and take the sum. The exact equation of the formula is as follows:    \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx \\approx \\Delta x[f(x_1) + f(x_2) + ..... + f(x_n)]$   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific case however, we have to do a bit more thinking. Considering a disk is being cut out of the kidney and that the disk is in the equation form of a circle, we can easily compute it's area as a constant and subtract from the approximation we get using the rectangle method on the kidney.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this method on the kidney, we need a clear way to calculate a y-value, in this case this will require us to convert the equation into polar like so: \n",
    "\n",
    "$(x^2 + y^2)^2 = x^3 + y^3 \\rightarrow r^4 = r^3(sin^3\\theta + cos^3\\theta) \\rightarrow r = sin^3\\theta + cos^3\\theta$ \n",
    "\n",
    "With this we can actually perform the rectangle method as we can treat r as our y-value and the bounds for theta or what is essentially x in this case is from 0 to 2 $\\pi$. This has to be slightly adapted though as we are now in the polar plane, each \"rectangle\" instead of being f(x) * $\\Delta x$ it's now $1/2 * r^2 * \\Delta \\theta$ as it's a circular cut. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is derived from the fact that a normal circle is $\\pi r^2$ which when only taking a fraction of the circle\n",
    "we get $(\\theta /(2 \\pi)) *(\\pi r^2)$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus simplifying to what we had stated prior! \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our formula, all that's left to decide is the number of intervals we want for our accuracy, in our case I believe 10,000 intervals will be enough to get me close to an approximation within 4 significant digits. \n",

    "### Problem Description \n",
    "\n",
    "Given some N x N matrix called A filled with uniformly distributed floating-point random numbers,   \n",
    "and a vector, b, of size n with 1 as all of it's elements, write a program to solve AX = b, if N = 66.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Description  \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm I used to solve Ax=b in this case was gaussian-elimination. To explain the algorithm, it consists of two parts. Forward Elimination and Backward Substitution and this is all done on the augmented matrix A|b. The essential idea behind Forward Elimination is that we want to create an upper triangular matrix, meaning all the entries below the diagonal are 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this we need a pivot row for each diagonal entry that will be scaled and subtracted from the other rows to 0 out the values below that entry. To find this row, I took the row with the maximum absolute value for that diagonal entry and swapped it with the row that was previously there. After doing this for every diagonal entry, the matrix is now in the form of an upper triangular matrix and Back Substitution can now be done. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back Substituion starts in the last row, as we can easily solve for the x value in that row because that was our last diagonal entry, meaning no other variables are in the equation represented by that row. With this known value we can now go one up from the last row and solve. This can happen because in an upper triangular matrix, the rows above can only contain variables/unknowns from the rows below besides the unknown   \n",
    "already in that row. So, if we start solving repeatedly from the bottom, we can solve each row one at a time as they're will only be one unknown each time. Eventually, we will have solved for all the unknowns in our system of equations, providing us the values for vector x which is the solution to our problem of Ax=b.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To set up this augmented matrix using numpy, I found numpy.random.uniform() to be useful in generating the N x N  matrix of uniformly distributed random floating point numbers, np.ones() to generate b, and np.hstack(), to create A|b. For the sake of validation numpy.linalg.solve() was used on A and b and the result was printed alongside the result I got to double check the validity of the gaussian-elimination I coded.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In terms of time complexity, Gaussian Elimination is O(n^3) where n is the number of rows and columns for the matrix being solved as doing Forward Elimination takes around n^3 operations and is the dominating term. Backward Substitution afterall, only takes O(n^2) operations and does not dominate.   \n",
